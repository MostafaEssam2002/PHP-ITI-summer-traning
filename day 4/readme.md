## üéØ Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Dynamic Header Display
- **Objective**: Create a script that prompts the user for their name and displays it in multiple header tags (H1-H6)
- **Implementation**: Used `prompt()` to get user input and `document.writeln()` to display the name in different header sizes
- **Skills Practiced**: DOM manipulation, user input handling

### Task 2: Sum Calculator with Conditions
- **Objective**: Create a program that continuously asks for numbers and calculates their sum until specific conditions are met
- **Features**:
  - Accepts numeric input from user
  - Stops when user enters 0
  - Stops when sum exceeds 100
  - Handles invalid input with error messages
  - Provides option to cancel input
- **Implementation**: Used `while` loop, `prompt()`, input validation, and conditional logic
- **Skills Practiced**: Loops, conditionals, input validation, error handling

### Task 3: FizzBuzz Checker
- **Objective**: Create an interactive FizzBuzz checker with a web interface
- **Features**:
  - Input field for number entry
  - Button to check the number
  - Displays "fizz" for multiples of 3
  - Displays "buzz" for multiples of 5
  - Displays "fizz buzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5
  - Displays the number itself if no conditions are met
- **Implementation**: HTML form elements with JavaScript event handling
- **Skills Practiced**: DOM manipulation, event handling, modular arithmetic

### Task 4: "Who Am I?" Animal Guessing Game
- **Objective**: Create an interactive decision tree game that guesses animals
- **Features**:
  - Beautiful, responsive UI with animations
  - Decision tree logic with yes/no questions
  - Covers different animal categories (flying, sea, land animals)
  - Distinguishes between wild and domestic animals
  - Visual feedback with emojis and styled results
  - Play again functionality
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Y/N keys)
- **Implementation**: Complex JavaScript object structure, CSS animations, responsive design
- **Skills Practiced**: Advanced DOM manipulation, decision trees, CSS styling, user experience design

### Task 5: User Information Validator (Current Active Task)
- **Objective**: Create a comprehensive user information validation system
- **Features**:
  - Color choice validation (red, green, blue only)
  - Name validation (characters only, no numbers)
  - Phone number validation (exactly 8 digits)
  - Mobile number validation (11 digits starting with 010, 011, or 012)
  - Email validation using regular expressions
  - Date information display (day name, month, year)
  - Colored output based on user choice
  - Option to re-enter information
- **Implementation**: Advanced form validation, regular expressions, date manipulation
- **Skills Practiced**: Input validation, regular expressions, date handling, user feedback

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure and semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core logic, DOM manipulation, and interactivity
- **Regular Expressions**: Email and phone number validation

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. The current active task (Task 5) will be displayed
4. To view other tasks, uncomment the respective HTML sections in `index.html`

## üìã Key Learning Outcomes
- **Input Validation**: Implemented comprehensive validation for different data types
- **User Experience**: Created intuitive interfaces with proper error handling
- **Code Organization**: Structured code using functions and modular approach
- **DOM Manipulation**: Extensive practice with JavaScript DOM methods
- **Regular Expressions**: Applied regex patterns for email and phone validation
- **Date Handling**: Worked with JavaScript Date objects for dynamic content
- **Conditional Logic**: Implemented complex decision trees and validation logic
- **Event Handling**: Managed user interactions through various input methods

## üîç Code Quality Features
- Input sanitization and validation
